# TheSupercake
Basic 2D platformer where you can switch between 2 worlds to complete platofrmer puzzles.
Switching between worlds makes some platforms or parts of the level intangible and you then use that to get over gaps or through walls.

This game was made in 2022 when I was 15 years old for the Jame Gam #20 and the game got overall 12th in the game jam.
The cake comes from the mid game jam theme that contestants had to incorporate into the game. The game was also made in only 4 days.
